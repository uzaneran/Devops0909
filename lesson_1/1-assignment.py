# A
first = 7

print("add", first + second)
print("multi", first * second)
print("divide", second / first)

# B
a = 9
b = 8
c = 15

# C
# a. there's no difference, their both strings, they both will print the value - john
# b. you cannot concat string with int
# suggestion:
my_number = 5 + 5
print("result is:", my_number)

# D
# 7

# challenge
a = 8
b = "123"
print(a + int(b))
